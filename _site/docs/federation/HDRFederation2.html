<p>2.     Versioning and publishing
===</p>

<p> </p>

<p>A registry will contain Data Models that will be in different stages of
development, currently we envisage:</p>

<p> </p>

<p>1.     Draft – Data Models are being built and changed, the contents are not
fixed and therefore the data model cannot be used by another (federated)
registry.</p>

<p>2.     Live – A Data Model will be fixed in terms of its technical structure and
metadata</p>

<p>3.     Published – A Data Model can be published to other organisations within
the federation, and some aspects of the metadata are made available and
searchable for all.</p>

<p>4.     Superceded – A Data Model can be replaced as the current “Live” or
“Published” version, however it is still accessible and available within the
registry. Users are aware by its status that there is a newer version available.</p>

<p>5.     Deprecated – A Data Model is no longer used and maybe deleted in the near
future.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><em>As a researcher I need to collaborate with other researchers in my organisation
to build a new research dataset, and therefore we both need access to a “draft”
Data Model which we can alter and update until we are happy with it.</em></p>

<p> </p>

<p><em>As a researcher I need to make my Data Model available and publish it locally,
at this point it is given a new unique identifier, such as &lt;domain name&gt;&lt;data
model identifier – version 1.0.0&gt;, see the first pass of the version diagram –
Figure X.</em></p>

<p> </p>

<p><em>As a researcher I need to update an existing Live Data Model. In this case I
would create a new version, as a draft, which would then become &lt;domain
name&gt;&lt;data model identifier – version 1.0.0&gt; of the data model (see Figure X
below), and it would replace version 1.0.0 as the current “live” version, itself
being now marked as “superceded”.</em></p>
