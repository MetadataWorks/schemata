<p>2.Â Â Â Â  Versioning and publishing
===</p>

<p>Â </p>

<p>A registry will contain Data Models that will be in different stages of
development, currently we envisage:</p>

<p>Â </p>

<p>1.Â Â Â Â  Draft â€“ Data Models are being built and changed, the contents are not
fixed and therefore the data model cannot be used by another (federated)
registry.</p>

<p>2.Â Â Â Â  Live â€“ A Data Model will be fixed in terms of its technical structure and
metadata</p>

<p>3.Â Â Â Â  Published â€“ A Data Model can be published to other organisations within
the federation, and some aspects of the metadata are made available and
searchable for all.</p>

<p>4.Â Â Â Â  Superceded â€“ A Data Model can be replaced as the current â€œLiveâ€ or
â€œPublishedâ€ version, however it is still accessible and available within the
registry. Users are aware by its status that there is a newer version available.</p>

<p>5.Â Â Â Â  Deprecated â€“ A Data Model is no longer used and maybe deleted in the near
future.</p>

<p>Â </p>

<p><em>As a researcher I need to collaborate with other researchers in my organisation
to build a new research dataset, and therefore we both need access to a â€œdraftâ€
Data Model which we can alter and update until we are happy with it.</em></p>

<p>Â </p>

<p><em>As a researcher I need to make my Data Model available and publish it locally,
at this point it is given a new unique identifier, such as &lt;domain name&gt;&lt;data
model identifier â€“ version 1.0.0&gt;, see the first pass of the version diagram â€“
Figure X.</em></p>

<p>Â </p>

<p><em>As a researcher I need to update an existing Live Data Model. In this case I
would create a new version, as a draft, which would then become &lt;domain
name&gt;&lt;data model identifier â€“ version 1.0.0&gt; of the data model (see Figure X
below), and it would replace version 1.0.0 as the current â€œliveâ€ version, itself
being now marked as â€œsupercededâ€.</em></p>
