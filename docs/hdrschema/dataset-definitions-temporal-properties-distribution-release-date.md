```

Date of the latest release of the dataset. If this is a regular release i.e. quarterly, or this is a static dataset please complete this alongside Periodicity. If this is Irregular or Continuously released please leave this blank. Notes: Periodicity and release date will be used to determine when the next release is expected. i.e. the next release date can then be calculated automatically. E.g. if the release date is documented as 01/01/2020 and it is now 20/04/2020 and there is a quarterly release schedule, the latest release will be calculated as 01/04/2020.
