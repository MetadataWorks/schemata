# Abstract Schema

```txt
http://healthdatagateway.org/schema/dataset.json#/definitions/summary/properties/abstract
```

Provide a clear and brief descriptive signpost for researchers who are searching for data that may be relevant to their research. The abstract should allow the reader to determine the scope of the data collection and accurately summarise its content. The optimal length is one paragraph (limited to 255 characters) and effective abstracts should avoid long sentences and abbreviations where possible. Note: Researchers will view Titles and Abstracts when searching for datasets and choosing whether to explore their content further. Abstracts must be different from the full description for a dataset.
