# Data Controller Schema

```

Data Controller means a person/entity who (either alone or jointly or in common with other persons/entities) determines the purposes for which and the way any Data Subject data, specifically personal data or are to be processed. Notes: For most organisations this will be the same as the publisher of the dataset. If this is not the case, please indicate that there is a different controller. If there is a different controller please complete the Data Processor attribute to indicate that the publisher is a Processor rather than the data controller.
